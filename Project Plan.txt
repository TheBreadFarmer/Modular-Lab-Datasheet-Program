Goals:
1. Be able to create tables
  1.a. Be able to select what type of table to make
    1.a.I. Types of tables include; Data table, Calculation Table, 
  1.a. Be able to select number of rows and columns
  1.b. Be able to define what each row and column contains
    1.b.I. This would look like a prompt that asks the user what will be in each row and column. example: row 1 = title

  +Customize individual Raw Data Table Names? = (checkbox)
    //If yes
    +Name of Table 1 = (short input/string)
    +Name of Table 2 = (short input/string)
    //etc...
    +Name of Table n = (short input/string)  <--n = users input to # of constants-->
    //If no
    +Name of Tables = (short input/string)
+Add constants column? = (checkbox)
  //If yes
  +Number of constants = (short input/int)
    +Name of Constant 1 = (short input/string)
    -Units = (short input/string)  <--format the users response by putting parenthases() around the response then inputing it one space after the name of the constraint-->

  -Units = (short input/string)
  -Include Uncertainty column? = (checkbox)  <--If checked format the Uncertainty column title as (the users input to Name of Value) + "Uncertainty" || example; Name of Value 1 = Beans. Then Uncertainty column title = Beans Uncertainty-->
